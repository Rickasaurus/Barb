Barb is a small dynamic scripting language for .NET

--

I created Barb because I needed a user language for my applications but yet no existing .NET language hosted nicely inside of my application.  This was my criteria:

- Simple/Terse Syntax
- Expression Oriented
- No casting necessary 
- Transparent type conversions
- Native .NET type system
- Tries really hard to do what a non-technical user would expect

Dynamic Linq, IronPython and IronRuby all failed for one of these reasons or another.

The current implementation is still young and a bit rough around the edges. I needed to get something out fast for my product and as of writing this the first line of code was written three days ago.  Right now it's useful for writing one-line expressions along these lines:

"(Name.Contains "John" or Name.Contains "Mary") and (Age > 20 or Weight > 200)"

Maybe it's early to share it, but I thought it might be useful to others in its current form.

Barb aims to accomplish the above goals through two somewhat non-traditional design decisions:

- Expression lists instead of expression trees
- Composition instead of IL or code generation

Expression lists allow for tuple-wise reductions to a result, instead of standard code generation or expression building.  Decisions can be made at runtime based on the contents of these tuples and their neighbors. 

Function/Value composition isn't strictly necessary but it sure makes the whole process easier.

In this way it's kind of Scheme-like under the hood, but on the surface it's very C#/F#ish.
